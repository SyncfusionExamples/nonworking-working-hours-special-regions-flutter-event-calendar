# How to highlight the working and non-working hours in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to highlight the working and non-working hours in the Flutter Calendar.

Using the Calendar's [specialRegions](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/calendar/timslot-views#special-time-regions) property, you can highlight the time slots for working and non-working hours in the Flutter Event Calendar.

In this sample, using the recurrence rule property of the time region the time regions are added on the working and non working hours in the Flutter Calendar.
